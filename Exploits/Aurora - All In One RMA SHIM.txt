# Flashing
- dd - works normally
- rufus - use dd mode
- chromebook recovery utility - i mean i guess it's usable

# Booting Shims

- Here's a list of shims that are built in to not boot:
  1. Raw shims  -  You don't need to boot a raw shim. The raw shim option in SH1MMER has also been removed when booted in Aurora.
  2. Priism and IRS - Aurora is quite literally a merger of these two.
- Here's a list of shims that we've tested and they work:
  1. SH1MMER (contains cryptosmite and icarus)
  2. Shimboot (:3)
  3. KVS
  4. Aurora (great scott!)
- Here's a list of shims we're gonna make work and test:
  3. Any future shims that are made

# How to format issues:
1. Board Name
2. If it’s a shim issue, make sure it’s valid by running this in aurora: ```losetup -Pf /usr/share/aurora/images/shims/whateveryourshimis.bin && lsblk```
and send it with your report.
3. attempt to describe the issue in detail
4. put it in gh issues!!! we’re more likely to see those
