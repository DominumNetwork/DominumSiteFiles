Block extensions by lagging the sh1t out of them (haha get it)

# Requirements:
1. Shitty ram
2. croxyproxy.com blocked  and sites.google.com unblocked

(if croxyproxy isn't blocked, just use croxyproxy instead of this sob)

# Steps:
1. Open 2 tabs of https://sites.google.com/view/gsh1tes (its like 200 embeds of croxyproxy.com in a page)
2. Close everything else
3. Hold down control tab
4. after a while open a tab that would normally be blocked
5. maybe profit, maybe crash chromebook

you can also use this to crash ppls chromebooks
