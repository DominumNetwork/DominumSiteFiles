## DEVELOPER MODE MUST BE RESTRICTED FOR THIS TO WORK
*it has came to my attention that this exploit is not new. however most people have forgotten of the exploit's existence; allowing me to, therefore, keep this post up in reverence to sabrina's discovery.*

Anastrophe (derived from Greek) is an exploit abusing an intended feature within Chrome OS’s oobe sequence. Essentially, the exploit allows you to downgrade to whichever version you were previously on. It has been proven to work on the latest Chrome version, v136. This exploit was found by @gabeisthatyou, I merely expanded the unaddressed aspects. 

## Instructions:
* Enter Recovery Mode
* Commence the developer mode sequence (it is expected to fail)
* As soon as the fail screen appears, press Escape + Enter
* Once rebooted, enter demo mode (via CTRL + Alt + D) & connect to wifi
* Press CTRL + Alt + Shift + R twice, then press revert

**For best results, wait until demo mode asks you to agree with policies to do step five**

## Returning to your school-enforced version (requires newer recovery UI):
* Enter Recovery Mode
* Press Internet Recovery and allow itself to complete 
* Powerwash via developer mode’s fail safe sequence.
